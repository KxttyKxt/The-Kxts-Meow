The Kxt's Meow 🐈

📖 My girlfriend and I have very different playstyles. As she walks the globe, collecting flowers and looting chiefly non-violent stuctures, I am in the deepest, darkest dungeon exercising my inner loot goblin. Sound familiar? Then this is for you!💗 This pack's goal is to bridge these differing modes of play. This is threefold:

*   I can play my way, she can play her way, and we can _both_ make meaningful progress therein.
*   I have incentive to try things closer to her style, and she has incentive vice versa.
*   We can adventure _together_ and **_have fun_**.

📝 Our main focuses are variety, multiplayer, exploration, and farming, with some bonus attention to decoration. Below are some key aspects of the pack.

🗺️ Explore! So many new structures, both peaceful and action-packed, small and large, above and underground are waiting.

🌖 At night and underground, hostile mobs **only attack if you attack first**, but _all_ nearby mobs retaliate. Be warned, though: mobs guarding structures will stick attack on-sight.

💞 You spawn with some useful items, including **Heartstones**! When two heartstones are paired, using one of them always points to the holder of the other, even over thousands of blocks. On top of this, combining a written **Antique Atlas** with a blank one will sync them both forever! Combine these with HUD elements from **RPG Parties** to always know other players' well-being.

🍪 So many foods! With **Farmer's Delight** and **many add-ons**, craft and eat a diverse range of foods for special buffs. There are even custom recipes to address duplicate items and inconsistent recipes.

🪴 Decor! With mods like **Another Furniture, Beautify,** and more, make your house fabulous.

⚔️ Up your arsenal with **new arrow types and weapon types, stylish armor, and magic spellbooks**! No **new bosses** are too strong to be taken down.

✨ Enjoy enriched content across the board with mods like **Quark & Quark Oddities, Supplementaries, Backpacked**, and more. Additionally, a large suite of mods for **performance, OptiFine parity**, and tons of **special visual features** are waiting.

❓ So much more is to be discovered. Give it a try!
