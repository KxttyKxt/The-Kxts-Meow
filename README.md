The Kxt's Meow 🐈
=================

💗 This modpack is dedicated to the adventures of myself (KxttyKxt) and my partner. She likes to farm, explore, raise animals, make things pretty; I like to crawl through dungeons like a loot goblin and fight huge battles. We have very different playstyles, but **this modpack aims to bridge the gap**.

🌎 There are many familiar mods, like **Quark, Better Combat, Farmer's Delight (and addons), Environmental, Dungeon Crawl, Iron's Spellbooks n Spells,** and more that establish a vanilla+ and generally enriched environment with some fancy stuff in between. In addition, there are mods that I am not familiar with: **Regions Unexplored, Beautify, Critters and Companions, Divine Weaponry, Knight Quest Reforged and plenty more there as well.**

⚡ This modpack is also enriched with a suite of performance mods, optimization mods, and others to achieve some semblance of **OptiFine parity and shaders**. Live an easier Minecraft life with plenty of **QoL options** as well.

⚔️ For other KxttyKxt's, enjoy more enchantments, weapons, monsters, dungeons, loots, and excursions.  
💐 For other Hailey's, enjoy many many flowers, decorations, crops, animals, structures, huge vistas, and more space to hold all those flowers in a backpack and some bundles.   
💬 And for all, enjoy an enhanced multiplayer experience with mods like **Watut, Heartstone, Backpacked** interactions, **RPG Parties, Simple Voice Chat**, and even a **Transmog** system to show off the perfect look.

🌠 There's a lot more to come! I have plans for custom origins, more structures, and of course whatever my partner can't live without (😭).
